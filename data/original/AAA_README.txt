Moy, Javi, Elena, Ester and Ztest data added.

Moy did the full 50 instances per class.
Javi did the full 50 instances per class, but in the order 214365, as he is left handed (right hand was first).
Elena and Ester did 25 instances per class, they are novices and the data may have to be discarded if it affects the classifier negatively.

Ztest is a set done by Zurita, it includes some combinations (123, 135, 1124...) it's a test to see the format of the future 'test' samples.
532, 132, 112, 112, 112, 115, 131, 115, 1122,1326,1326
All data will have to be resampled and possibly synchronized (left and right synchronization).
